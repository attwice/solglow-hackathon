# Introduction

Sup Dawg?

Conductive Research here and we're innovating ways blockchains like Solana and NFT's can be used with games.

We won [first prize](https://www.theblockbeats.com/en/flash/34946) at the Dora Hacks hackathon [with Zero NFT](https://dora.zeronft.com/) that allows you to turn any cryptopunk in your Metamask wallet into a video game character.

NFTs are going to be a killer solution for interoperable game content, but what if we took this idea a step further and NFTs gave you access to games? Imagine if your Steam library was a collection of NFTs instead of game licenses. This would open a world of possibilities like truly limited-edition digital games and allow gamers to resell digital games they purchased in an open marketplace.

We built Solglow for the Star Atlas Arcade to show a glimpse of the future. 

# How it works

Solglow reads a Phantom wallet and looks for NFTs we minted on the Solana network. Each NFT gives you access to a different game in our virtual arcade.

Along with classics like Shadowrun, we made limited-edition games with memes inside them that you can only play on Solglow. We canâ€™t wait to see players drive through Super Solana Cart and blast through Starfox: Degen Academy

# How to play

* First download the Phantom Solana wallet for Chrome/Brave: [https://phantom.app/](https://phantom.app/)
* Use the invite code "COIN"
* Go to the settings and select "Change Network"

* Now get some NFTs, go to the SolGlow Vending machine here: [https://solglow.zeronft.com/vending/](https://solglow.zeronft.com/vending/)

* Enter your wallet and submit. Your broke ass got No SOL? No sweat, we got you baby!

# How to run locally


### Front-end
Running the code locally is simple, on MacOS/Linux run:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

and it should spawn a local webserver. You can view the game by visiting `http://localhost:8000`

### Back-end

You will need to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed

* [Generate your keypair file](https://spl.solana.com/token) and place it in the directory `vending/server/solana.json`
* Build the `Dockerfile` image by running `docker build -t solglow .` in the directory `/vending/server`
* Run docker `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 solglow`
* Now you can access the back-end Flask API at `http://localhost:8000`

### Running on production

This part it slightly more involved. You will want to install Ngnix so that it can behave as a proxy for your Docker container and the internet.

* First install ngnix `sudo apt-get install ngnix`
* Create a config file `nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/solglow`
* Save the following config
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name solglow.mydomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
* Next enable this configuration `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/solglow /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/solglow`
* And reload the config on that bad boy `sudo service nginx configtest`
* And restart your web server `sudo service nginx restart`
* Now your api should be available at `solglow.mydomain.com`
* NOTE: You'll need to setup your CNAME/A RECORD in your DNS settings

## Deriving json keypair

If you have already generated your wallet and have the private and public key but want to generate the json file spl-token program requires you can easily do that by taking your private key, decoding it from base58 and converting the resulting binary to ascii codes. The public key will be the first 32 byte array values. The entire private key must be in JSON format

* Import Base58 Python: https://pypi.org/project/base58
* Decode your secret key: `secret_key_binary = base58.b58decode(WALLET_SECRET_KEY)`
* Public key JSON: `public_key_byte_byte_array = [int(c) for c in secret_key_binary][:32]`
* Private key JSON: `private_key_byte_array = [int(c) for c in secret_key_binary]`

# Technical

This game was built with:
* Front-end: VueJS
* Web3: SolanaWeb3
* Vending machine: python + docker + spl-token-cli hackery because the docs suck
